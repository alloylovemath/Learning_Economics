# Saving, Investment and the Financial System

**Berief idea**:  
* **Financial system**: the group of institutions in the economy that help
to match one person’s saving with another person’s investment;
* Develop a model of supply and demand for funds in financial markets;
* **Interest rate** is the price that adjusts to balance supply and demand

## $\S 1$ Financial Institutions in the U.S. Economy

Financial institutions can be grouped into two categories: financial markets
and financial intermediaries.

### $\S 1.1$ Financial Markets

**Financial market**: financial institutions through which savers can directly
provide funds to borrowers.

The two most important financial markets in our economy (US economy) are the
**bond market and the stock market**.

#### $\S 1.1.1$ Bond Market

Some basic terms:  
* bond: a certificate of indebtedness, or an IOU (I owe you, 借据);
* bond buyer - lender;
* date of maturity - the time at which the loan will be repaid;
* principal - repayment of the amount borrowed;

**Key characters of a bond**:  
* **term**—the length of time until the bond matures;
* **credit risk**-the probability that the borrower will fail to pay some of
the interest or principal;  
	a failure to pay is called a default
* **tax treatment**—the way the tax laws treat the interest earned on the bond;  
	bonds issued by state and local governments called municipal bonds, which
	are not required to pay federal income tax
* **inflation protection**  
	Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

#### $\S 1.1.2$ The Stock Market

A share of stock represents ownership in a firm and is, therefore, a claim to
some of the profits that the firm makes.

The sale of stock to raise money is called **equity finance**, whereas the sale
of bonds is called **debt finance**.

The most important stock exchanges in the U.S. economy are **the New York Stock
Exchange** and the **Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations)**.

The most important stock exchanges around the world are those in Tokyo,
Shanghai, Hong Kong, and London.

Because stock prices reflect expected profitability, these stock indexes are
watched closely as possible indicators of future economic conditions.

### $\S 1.2$ Financial Intermediaries

**Financial intermediaries** are financial institutions through which savers can
indirectly provide funds to borrowers.

#### $\S 1.2.1$ Banks

A primary job of banks is to take in deposits from people who want to save and
use these deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow.

The difference between these rates of interest covers the banks’ costs and
returns some profit to the owners of the banks.

Banks help create a special asset that people can use as a **medium of
exchange**, which distinguishes them from many other financial institutions.

#### $\S 1.2.2$ Mutual Funds

A mutual fund is an institution that sells shares to the public and uses the
proceeds to buy a selection, or portfolio, of various types of stocks, bonds, or
both stocks and bonds.

"despite their differences, these financial institutions all serve the same
goal: directing the resources of savers into the hands of borrowers."

## $\S 2$ Saving and Investment in the National Income Accounts

### $\S 2.1$ Some Important Identities

**Time to do some transformation!**

$$
Y = C + I + G + NX.
$$

Assume that we are facing a *closed economy*:  

$$
Y = C + I + G\\
\Rightarrow Y - C - G = I.
$$

Let $S = Y - C - G$, it is the total income in the economy that remains after
paying for consumption and government purchases: This amount is called
**national saving**, or just **saving**. We can push further here. Let $T$
denote the tax revenue, then we get:  

$$
S = Y - C - G\\
\Rightarrow S = (Y - C - T) + (T - G).
$$

Here:  
* $Y - C - T$: **private saving**, the amount of income that households have
left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption;
* $T - G$: **public saving** is the amount of tax revenue that the government
has left after paying for its spending  
	When public saving is positive ie. $T - G > 0$, we call it **budget
	surplus**;  
	When $T - G < 0$, we call it **budget deficit**.

**For the (closed) economy as a whole, saving must equal investment.**:  

$$
S = I.
$$

Although the accounting identity $S = I$ shows that saving and investment are
equal for the economy as a whole, it does not mean that saving and investment
are equal for every individual household or firm.

### $\S 2.2$ The Meaning of Saving and Investment

The words *saving* and *investment* in daily life might be different from they
are in the macroeconomics.

## $\S 3$ The Market for Loanable Funds

Assume there is only one financial market-market for loanable funds;
The price of the market is the interest rate. We shall be clear that the
real interest rate more accurately reflects the real return to saving and the
real cost of borrowing. Therefore, the supply and demand for loanable funds
**depend on the real (rather than nominal) interest rate**.

* Supply: saving (extra income), increases as interest rate goes up;
* Demand: investment, decreases as interest rate goes up

**Three steps to analysis the supply and demand**:  
First, we decide whether the policy shifts the supply curve or the demand curve.
Second, we determine the direction of the shift. Third, we use the
supply-and-demand diagram to see how the equilibrium changes.

Section $\S 3.1$ and $\S 3.2$ will pass.

### $\S 3.3$ Policy 3: Government Budget Deficits and Surpluses

To be clear (especially for Chinese), here, the investment is the private
investment.

Two things can lead to budget deficits-government purchase rise or tax revenue
fall:  
* $G \uparrow$: will lead to the decrease in public saving, thus make the
supply of loanable fund decrease. Eventually, the interest rate raise and
investment fall;  
	In other words, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit,
	it reduces the supply of loanable funds available to finance investment by
	households and firms.  
	The fall in investment due to government borrowing is represented by the
	movement along the demand curve and is called **crowding out (挤出)**. That
	is, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it crowds out
	private borrowers who are trying to finance investment.

* $T \downarrow$: will lead to public saving fall. For private saving, the tax
cut may lead the consumption rise, therefore make the private saving rises by
less than public saving declines. Overall, the national saving will fall.
Eventually, the interest rate raise and investment fall;

**When the government reduces national saving by running a budget deficit, the
interest rate rises and investment falls.**  
**A budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest
rate, and stimulates investment.**
