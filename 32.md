# A Macroeconomics Theory of the Open Economy

Brief idea: We will develop a model in this chapter, in this model,  
* takes the economy’s GDP as given;
* takes the economy’s price level as given
* it involves looking simultaneously at two related markets:
the market for loanable funds, market for foreign-currency exchange

## Supply and Demand for Loanable Funds and for Foreign-Currency Exchange

### The Market for Loanable Funds

$$
S = I + NCO.
$$

$S$-supplies; $I + NCO$-demand.

Loanable funds should be interpreted as the domestically generated flow of
resources available for capital accumulation. **The purchase of a capital asset
adds to the demand for loanable funds, regardless of whether that asset is
located at home (I) or abroad (NCO)**

**real interest rate affects its net capital outflow**;  
an increase in the U.S. real interest rate discourages Americans from buying
foreign assets and encourages foreigners to buy U.S. assets. reduces U.S. net
capital outflow

### The Market for Foreign-Currency Exchange

$$
NCO = NX.
$$

$NCO$-supply, $NX$-demand, **price-real exchange rate**.

**Demand curve-downward (in PPP, it should be horizontal)**, an appreciation of
the real exchange rate reduces the quantity of dollars demanded in the market
for foreign-currency exchange.

**Supply curve-verticle**, because net exports does not depend on the real
exchange rate, it depends on the real interest rate.  
> The supply curve is vertical because the quantity of dollars supplied for net
capital outflow does not depend on the real exchange rate. (As discussed
earlier, net capital outflow depends on the real interest rate. When discussing
the market for foreign-currency exchange, we take the real interest rate and net
capital outflow as given.)

## Equilibrium in the Open Economy

### Net Capital Outflow: The Link between the Two Markets

Net capital outflow is the variable that links these two markets.

**The key determinant of net capital outflow, as we have discussed, is the real
interest rate**

**net-capital-outflow curve**, shows the negative relationship between the real
interest rate and net capital outflow, is the link between the market for
loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange.

### Simultaneous Equilibrium in Two Markets

**Steps**:  
1. In loanable fund market, the real interest rate determined;
2. In net-capital-outflow curve, the quantity of net capital outflow determined;
3. In foreign-currency exchange market, the real exchange rate determined.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
S = I + NCO \Rightarrow r,\\
r \Rightarrow NCO,\\
q \Rightarrow e.
\end{array}
$$

* real interest rate->the price of goods and services in the present relative to
goods and services in the future;
* real exchange rate->the price of domestic goods and services relative to
foreign goods and services.

## How Policies and Events Affect an Open Economy

### Government Budget Deficits

some reviews:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\underbrace{(Y - C - T)}_{\text{private saving}} +
\underbrace{(T - G)}_{\text{public saving}} = I + NX
\end{array}
$$

**analysis**:  
1. Budget deficits-$T \downarrow$->public saving down, private saving may up or
down. But, even if private saving up, the ovarall effect will still be that the
saving down (see ch.26);
2. In loanable fund market, the supply down->higher interest rate->people borrow
less, investment down;
3. In net-capital-outflow curve, the higher interest rate drives down the
quantity of net capital outflow;
4. In foreign-currency exchange market, the supply down, cause exchange rate
rise, thus, the net export also down.

In an open economy, government budget deficits raise real interest rates, crowd
out domestic investment, cause the currency to appreciate, and push the trade
balance toward deficit. -- **twin deficits**

### Trade Policy

**analysis**:  
1. quota on a specific goods->affect imports->the demand of foreign-currency
exchange market down->exchange rate rise
2. **Because nothing has happened in the market for loanable funds, there is no
change in the real interest rate**;
3. **Because there is no change in the real interest rate, there is also no
change in net capital outflow**;
4. **because there is no change in net capital outflow, there can be no change
in net exports, even though the import quota has reduced imports**

->**Trade policies do not affect the trade balance**.

Review: in our model, takes the economy’s GDP as given, and look at the
identity:

$$
NX = NCO = S - I.
$$

**Trade policies do not alter the trade balance because they do not alter
national saving or domestic investment**.

Although trade policies do not affect a country’s overall trade balance, these
policies do affect specific firms, industries, and countries. The effects of
trade policies are, therefore, more microeconomic than macroeconomic.

### Political Instability and Capital Flight

**capital flight**: a large and sudden movement of funds out of a country

**analysis**:  
* capital flight affect both market also the net-capital-outflow curve;
* In net-capital-outflow curve, it drives the curve to shift to the right;
* In loanable market, it rise the demand, so the demand curve shift to the
right->**higher interest rate** (yes, the higher interest rate have the ability
to decrease the net capital outflow, but compare to capital flight, its effect
is small);
* In foreign-currenct exchange market, the supply curve shift to the right->
exchange rate decrease;

->**capital flight from a country increases its interest rates and decreases the
value of the its currency in the market for foreign-currency exchange.**

->**rising interest rates and a falling currency**

rising interest rates->less domestic investment->economic growth decrease;  
falling currency->trade deficit

> The study of international economics is valuable, but we should be careful not
to exaggerate its importance
