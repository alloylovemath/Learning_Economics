# Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

Brief ideas:  
* **recession**: a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment;
* **depression**: a severe recession;
* What we will deal with is the **short-run fluctuation** in economic activity,
and the model we are about to learn is **the model of aggregate demand and
aggregate supply**.

short-run: "year to year", long-run: "generation to generation".

## Three Key Facts about Economic Fluctuations

### Fact 1: Economic Fluctuations Are Irregular and Unpredictable

**the business cycle**: fluctuations in the economy, economic fluctuations
correspond to changes in business conditions

economic fluctuations are not at all regular, and they are almost impossible to
predict with much accuracy

### Fact 2: Most Macroeconomic Quantities Fluctuate Together

Most macroeconomic variables that measure some type of income, spending, or
production fluctuate closely together. But some of them may fluctuate by
different amounts.

When the economy contracts, much of the contraction is due to reduced spending
on new factories, housing, and inventories i.e. the investment contracts more.

### Fact 3: As Output Falls, Unemployment Rises

when real GDP declines, the rate of unemployment rises.

## Explaining Short-Run Economic Fluctuations

Notice that: the theory of economic fluctuations remains controversial

### The Assumptions of Classical Economics

the classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality

### The Reality of Short-Run Fluctuations

Most economists believe that classical theory describes the world in the long
run but not in the short run.

In the short run, real and nominal variables are highly intertwined, and changes
in the money supply can temporarily push real GDP away from its long-run trend.

new model focuses on how real and nominal variables interact

### The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

**model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply** focused on two things:  
* output of economy-real GDP;
* average price level-CPI or GDP deflator

* **aggregate-demand curve**: shows the quantity of goods and services that
households, firms, the government, and customers abroad want to buy at each
price level;
* **aggregate-supply curve**: shows the quantity of goods and services that
firms produce and sell at each price level

The model here is quite different from those model of market demand and market
supply in microeconomics. **This microeconomic substitution from one market to
another is impossible for the economy as a whole**.

We need a macroeconomic theory that explains the total quantity of goods and
services demanded and the total quantity of goods and services supplied.

## The Aggregate-Demand Curve

the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward-other things being equal, a decrease
in the economy’s overall level of prices raises the quantity of goods and
services demanded, viceversa. Why?

### Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Slopes Downward

$$
Y = C + I + G + NX.
$$

Each of these four components contributes to the aggregate demand for goods and
services. Assume that government spending is fixed by policy, the three factors
lefted depend on economic conditions and, in particular, on the **price level**.

#### The Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect

When price level falls, your wealth and your ability to buy goods and services
grow.

**A decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes
consumers wealthier, thereby encouraging them to spend more. The increase in
consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded.**

#### The Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect

Price level down->the demand of currency down->people buy interest-bearing
assets->drive down interest rate->encourage investment (and consumption on
durable goods)

**A lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending on
investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services
demanded**

#### The Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Effect

As the preceding part tell us, price level down->interest rate down.

interest rate down->invesring abroad->supply in foreign-currency exchange market
increase->exchange rate down->domestic goods and services cheaper->imports down,
exports up->net export up

**When a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the
real value of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation
stimulates U.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and
services demanded**

->**the fall in the price level leads to an increase in the quantity of goods
and services demanded**->downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve

keep in mind that the aggregate-demand curve is drawn for a given quantity of
the money supply

### Why the Aggregate-Demand Curve Might Shift

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Consumption

any event that changes how much people want to consume at a given price level
shifts the aggregate-demand curve

eg: (1) people become more concerned about saving for retirement; (2) a stock
market boom; (3) government cuts taxes

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Investment

**Any event that changes how much firms want to invest at a given price level
also shifts the aggregate-demand curve**

eg: (1) newly introduced product; (2) optimistic or pessimistic; (3) an
investment tax credit; (4) money supply

money supply: an increase in the money supply lowers the interest rate in the
short run, stimulating investment spending and thereby shifting the
aggregate-demand curve to the right (more detailed explanation is in the next
chapter)

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Government Purchases

pass

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Net Exports

eg: (1) foreign countries' economic conditions; (2) international speculators
cause movements in the exchange rate

## The Aggregate-Supply Curve

the aggregate-demand curve, which always slopes downward.  
the aggregate-supply curve shows a relationship that depends crucially on the
time horizon examined

**In the long run, the aggregate-supply curve is vertical, whereas in the short
run, the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward**

### Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Is Vertical in the Long Run

Because the price level does not affect the long-run determinants of real GDP,
the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. the aggregate-supply curve is
vertical only in the long run.

### Why the Long-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift

Because classical macroeconomic theory predicts the quantity of goods and
services produced by an economy in the long run, it also explains the position
of the longrun aggregate-supply curve

**natural level of output**, alias-potential output, full-employment output: 
the production of goods and services that an economy achieves in the long run
when unemployment is at its normal rate.

Any change in the economy that alters the natural level of output shifts the
long-run aggregate-supply curve.

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Labor

eg: (1) immigration; (2) events that affect the natural rate of unemployment

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Capital (physical & human)

pass

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Natural Resources

pass

#### Shifts Arising from Changes in Technological Knowledge

eg: (not literally technological) (1) opening up international trade;
(2) preventing firms from using some production methods, perhaps to address
worker safety or environmental concerns

### Using Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply to Depict Long-Run Growth and Inflation

With the technology advance and the money supply increase overtime, we will see
increases in output and continuing inflation.

**The short-run fluctuations in output and the price level that we will be
studying should be viewed as deviations from the long-run trends of output
growth and inflation**

### Why the Aggregate-Supply Curve Slopes Upward in the Short Run

The key difference between the economy in the short run and in the long run is
the behavior of aggregate supply.

over a period of a year or two, an increase in the overall level of prices in
the economy tends to raise the quantity of goods and services supplied->the
short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward

Why? We will study three theories, and in each theory, a specific
**market imperfection** causes the supply side of the economy to behave
differently in the short run than it does in the long run

**common theme of the theories**: The quantity of output supplied deviates from
its long-run, or natural, level when the actual price level in the economy
deviates from the price level that people expected to prevail. Above expect->
rises above natural level.

#### The Sticky-Wage Theory

the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward because nominal wages are
based on **expected prices** and **do not respond immediately** when the actual
price level turns out to be different from what was expected->wages are “sticky”
in the short run

eg: price level down, revenue down, but cost remains->supply down

#### The Sticky-Price Theory

the prices of some goods and services also adjust sluggishly in response to
changing economic conditions, partly bacause of menu costs.

eg: price level down->high price for these lagging companies->sales down->supply
down

#### The Misperceptions Theory

eg: price level down->**mistakenly** believe that their relative prices have
fallen->reduce supply

### Why the Short-Run Aggregate-Supply Curve Might Shift

all those variables that shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve will do the
same thing for the short-run aggregate-supply curve.

**the expected price level**: An increase in the expected price level reduces
the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run
aggregate-supply curve to the left

## Two Causes of Economic Fluctuations

The analysis is basiclly the same except for that **(1) we shall consider two
equilibria; (2) we shall consider the transition from the short-run to the
long-run (expected price works here)**

### The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Demand

the pessimism that caused the shift in aggregate demand is, to some extent,
self-fulfilling: Pessimism about the future leads to falling incomes and rising
unemployment

**key lessons**:  
* In the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the
economy’s output of goods and services;
* In the long run, shifts in aggregate demand affect the overall price level but
do not affect output;
* Because policymakers influence aggregate demand, they can potentially
mitigate the severity of economic fluctuations.

### The Effects of a Shift in Aggregate Supply

* **stagnation**: falling output;
* **stagflation**: stagnation + inflation
* **wage-price spiral**: higher prices leading to higher wages, in turn leading
to even higher prices

**key lessons**:  
* Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession
(falling output) and inflation (rising prices);
* Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can mitigate the adverse
impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the problem of inflation

> The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long
run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless
a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us when
the storm is long past, the ocean will be flat. -- *John Maynard Keynes*
