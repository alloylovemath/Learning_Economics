# Open Economy Macroeconomics: Basic Concepts

* key macroeconomic variables that describe an open economy’s interactions
in world markets: **exports, imports, the trade balance, the exchange rate**
etc..

## The International Flows of Goods and Capital

### The Flow of Goods: Exports, Imports, and Net Exports

**Net exports**=**trade balance**.

### The Flow of Financial Resources: Net Capital Outflow

Terms like **trade surplus**, **trade deficit** are about the flow of goods and
services.

**net capital outflow**, alias **net foreign investment**: difference between
the purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents and the purchase of
domestic assets by foreigners.

The flow of capital between a country and the rest of the world takes two forms:
**foreign direct investment**, **foreign portfolio investment**, which we have
seen in Ch.25. The former-"active", the later-"passive".

### The Equality of Net Exports and Net Capital Outflow

**Identity on net export and net capital outflow**:  

$$
\text{NCO} = \text{NX}.
$$

Here, $\text{NCO}$ is the new capital outflow.

> something must happen to that $50 million.

* Trade surplus->Capital outflow;
* Trade deficit->Capital inflow.

The international flow of goods and services and the international flow of
capital are two sides of the same coin.

### Saving, Investment, and Their Relationship to the International Flows

$$
\begin{array}{c}
S = I + NX,\\
\Rightarrow S = I + NCO.
\end{array}
$$

## The Prices for International Transactions: Real and Nominal Exchange Rates

### Nominal Exchange Rates

Two ways:  
* units of foreign currency per domestic currency (eg: US);
* units of domestic currency per foreign currency (eg: CHN);

appreciation, depreciation-“strong” or “weak”

exchange-rate index, similar method used in the calculation of CPI

### Real Exchange Rates

**real exchange rate**: the rate at which a person can trade the goods and
services of one country for the goods and services of another. we express the
real exchange rate as units of the foreign item per unit of the domestic item.

In macroeconomics, we use price index instead of specific price:  

$$
\text{Real exchange rate} = \frac{e \times P}{P^{*}}.
$$

Here, $e$ is the nominal exchange rate, expressed in the units of foreign
currency per domestic currency; $P$ is the domestic CPI, $P^{*}$ is the foreign
CPI.

Real exchange rate falling, which means that domestic goods or sevices become
cheap, will encourages consumers both at home and abroad to buy more domestic
goods and fewer goods from other countries->Net exports rise.

## A First Theory of Exchange-Rate Determination: Purchasing-Power Parity

**purchasing-power parity**: a unit of any given currency should be able to buy
the same quantity of goods in all countries, thus the real exchange rate shall
be 1. Many economists believe that purchasing-power parity describes the forces
that determine exchange rates **in the long run**.

### The Basic Logic of Purchasing-Power Parity

**law of one price**: a good must sell for the same price in all locations.

**arbitrage**: the process of taking advantage of price differences for the same
item in different markets.

### Implications of Purchasing-Power Parity

If the purchasing power parity holds true:  
* real exchange rate is 1;
* It tells us that the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two
countries depends on the price levels in those countries

->**that nominal exchange rates change when price levels change**, when the
central bank prints large quantities of money, that money loses value both in
terms of the goods and services it can buy and in terms of the amount of other
currencies it can buy.

### Limitations of Purchasing-Power Parity

two reasons the theory of purchasing-power parity does not always hold in
practice:  
* The first reason is that many goods are not easily traded;
* The second reason that purchasing-power parity does not always hold is that
even tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes when they are produced in
different countries.

As the real exchange rate drifts from the level predicted by purchasing-power
parity, people have greater incentive to move goods across national borders.

PPP provide a reason to expect that changes in the real exchange rate are most
often small or temporary; large and persistent movements in nominal
exchange rates typically reflect changes in price levels at home and abroad.
