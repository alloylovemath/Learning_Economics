# Unemployment

**Some basic ideas**:  
* The problem of unemployment can be divided into two categories: the long-run
problem and the short-run problem;
* **Cyclical unemployment**, short-run, the year-to-year fluctuations in
unemployment around its natural rate and is closely associated with the
short-run fluctuations in economic activity;
* **natural rate of unemployment**, long-run, the amount of unemployment that
the economy normally experiences  
	not desirable, nor constant, just don't go away

* Three problems:  
	1. How does the government measure the economy’s rate of unemployment;
	2. What problems arise in interpreting the unemployment data;
	3. How long are the unemployed typically without work

## Identifying Unemployment

### How Is Unemployment Measured?

The related measuring job is done by [**Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS)**,
part of the Department of Labour](https://www.bls.gov/).

**3 Types**: Employed, Unemployed, Not in the labor force.

**Key figures**:  
* **Labour force**: the sum of the employed and the unemployed;
* **unemployment rate**: the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed;
* **labor-force participation rate**: the percentage of the total adult
population of the United States that is in the labor force

The BLS will give data for both the entire adult population and **more specific
groups**.

**Natural rate of unemployment**: the normal rate of unemployment around which
the unemployment rate fluctuates;  
**cyclical unemployment**: the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate

Except for those statistics, the BLS will give the data of types of employment
length of the average workweek, and the duration of unemployment.

### Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It to Measure?

It is much harder to distinguish between a person who is unemployed and a person
who is not in the labor force.

the BLS calculates several other measures of labor underutilization, from
**U-1** to **U-6**. Inside the measurement, some definition needs to be
clarified:  
* **Marginally attached workers**: persons who currently are neither working nor
looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and
have looked for work sometime in the recent past;
* **Discouraged workers**: individuals who would like to work but have given up
looking for a job;
* **Persons employed part-time for economic reasons** (灵活就业人员？): who want
and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule

### How Long Are the Unemployed without Work?

The crucial problem is **whether unemployment is typically a short-term or
long-term condition**.

**Most spells of unemployment are short, but most unemployment observed at any
given time is long-term.** So, **most of the economy’s unemployment problem is
attributable to the relatively few workers who are jobless for long periods of
time**.

### Why Are There Always Some People Unemployed?

* **frictional unemployment**: unemployment that results from the process of
matching workers and jobs;
* **structural unemployment**: unemployment that results because the number of
jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for
everyone who wants one

The BLS provides the number of jobs that the economy gained or lost in the
previous month along with unemployment figures. It can be seen as an indicator
of short-run economic trends.

## Job Search

### Why Some Frictional Unemployment Is Inevitable

Frictional unemployment is inevitable simply because the economy is always
changing. And, it is often the result of changes in the demand for labor
among different firms.

**sectoral shifts**: Changes in the composition of demand among industries or
regions.

**Comparative advantage, however, need not be stable over time.**

### Public Policy and Job Search

### Unemployment Insurance

Because unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed
devote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive
job offers.

Some economists argue that unemployment insurance improves the ability of the
economy to match each worker with the most appropriate job.

Eliminating unemployment insurance may reduce frictional unemployment. Yet even
so, such a change in policy could well diminish economic well-being.

## Minimum-Wage Laws

Minimum-wage have an important effect on certain groups with particularly high
unemployment rates. what kinds of workers reported earnings at or below the
minimum wage is a problem needs to pay attention.

friction unemployment or job search-searching, structural unemployment - waiting

> If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any reason, the result is
unemployment.

## Unions and Collective Bargaining

### The Economics of Unions

### Are Unions Good or Bad for the Economy?

* Critics:  
	1. merely a type of cartel;
	2. inefficient and inequitable;
* Advocate:  
	1. a necessary antidote to the market power of the firms that hire workers
	(eg: company town);
	2. helping firms respond efficiently to workers’ concerns (eg: hours of
	work, overtime, vacations, sick leave, health benefits, promotion schedules,
	job security, and so on)

## The Theory of Efficiency Wages

**Efficiency wages**-firms operate more efficiently if wages are above the
equilibrium level.

Reason: paying higher wages might increase profitability by increasing the
efficiency of a firm’s workers.

Minimum wages and union are both restriction from the outside which force firms
to pay a higher than equilibrium wages. While, efficient wages means that firms
are paying higher wages on their own.

### Worker Health

More salary-more nutritious diet-healthier-more productive

This may be relevant for explaining unemployment in less developed countries
where inadequate nutrition can be a problem.

### Worker Turnover

A firm can reduce turnover among its workers by paying them high wages;

Why do firms care about turnover? The reason is that it is costly for firms to
hire and train new workers. And the experience workers are more productive.
