# Measuring the Cost of Living

> Some ideas:  
>    * **CPI**: *consumer price index* - turn dollar figures into meaningful
measures of pruchasing power;
>    * inflation rate:  
    Can be calculate by GDP deflator, but CPI is better.  
    This is because CPI better reflects the goods and services bought by
    consumers.

## The Consumer Price Index

### How the CPI Is Calculated

**Steps**:  
* fix the backet: the backet might change (How to deal with the change?);
* Find the price;
* Compute the basket's cost;

**Figures' definition**:  

$$
\text{Comsumer price index} = \frac
{\text{Price of basket of goods and services in current year}}
{\text{Price of basket in base year}} \times 100.
$$

$$
\text{Inflation rate in year 2} = \frac
{\text{CPI in year 2} - \text{CPI in year 1}}
{\text{CPI in year 1}} \times 100.
$$

**Other price index**:  
* some narrow categories of goods and services, eg: food, clothing etc.;
* **core CPI**: CPI excludeing food and energy. Food and energy price often
shows substantial short-run volatility, so core CPI better reflects underlying
inflation trends;
* **PPI**: *producer price index*, measures the goods and services bought by
firms. The cost eventually pass on the costs to consumers, so changes in PPI are
often thought to be useful for predicting changes in the CPI.

### Problems in Measuring the Cost of Living

Three problems:  
* substitution bias: overstates the increase in the cost of living
from one year to the next;
* introduction of new goods: As new goods are introduced, consumers have more
choices, and each dollar is worth more;
* unmeasured quality change;

There are already a lot of alternative ways to measure the cost of livelihood, 
the problem is not which one is better, but to have more ways.

### The GDP Deflator versus the Consumer Price Index

Usually, these two statistics tell a similar story. Yet two important differences can cause them to diverge:  
* produced domestically vs. bought by consumers;  
    This first difference between the CPI and the GDP deflator is particularly
    important when the price of oil changes.
* The second and subtler difference between the GDP deflator and the CPI
concerns how various prices are weighted to yield a single number for the
overall level of prices.

## Correcting Economic Variables for the Effects of Inflation

### Dollar Figures from Different Times

Just one formula:  

$$
\text{Amount in today’s dollars} = \text{Amount in year } T \text{ dollars}
\times \frac
{\text{Price level today}}
{\text{Price level in year }T}.
$$

**By the way, you should also pay attention to the variation in the cost of
living from one place to another.**

### Indexation

When some dollar amount is automatically corrected for changes in the price
level by law or contract, the amount is said to be indexed for inflation.

### Real and Nominal Interest Rates

**deflation**—negative inflation

**The formula for real interest rate**:  

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Accurate formula: } & 1 + r_{\text{real}} = \frac
{1 + r_{\text{nomial}}}{1 + \pi},\\
\Rightarrow & r_{\text{real}} = \frac
{r_{\text{nomial}} - \pi}{1 + \pi}.\\
\text{Approx formula: } & r_{\text{real}} = r_{\text{nomial}} - \pi.
\end{align*}
$$

Here $\pi$ is the inflation rate.

"the higher the rate of inflation, the smaller the increase in Sara’s purchasing
power"

* $r_{\text{nomial}}$: nomial interest rate: measures the change in dollar
accounts;
* $r_{\text{real}}$: real interest rate: tells how fast the purchasing power of
your bank account rises over times.
