# Measuring a Nation's Income

Some ideas:  
* **GDP**: gross domestic product, **total income** of a nation;
* GDP is thought to be the single best measure of society's economic well-being?

## Income and Expenditure

More income means better situation, for a person. This holds true for the
nation.

GDP measures two things at once: the **total income** of everyone in the economy
and the **total expenditure** on the economy’s output of goods and services.

For an economy as a whole, **income must equal expenditure**.  
Every transaction has two parties: a buyer and a seller.  

Two ways to compute the GDP: adding up the total expenditure by households or by
adding up the total income paid bu firms.

**Question**: Inventories?

## The Measurement of GDP

**Specific definition of GDP**:  
    The market value of all final goods and services produced within a country
    in a given period of time.

Some things need pay attention:  
* GDP includes the market value of the housing service provided by the economy's
stock of housing (base on the assumping that the owner is renting the house to
themselves).
* "final good" versus "intermediate good" (how to deal with inventories);
* does not include transactions involving items produced in the past;
* within a country (compare to GNP);
* at an aunual rate, seasonal adjustment?

**Other measures**:  
* **GDI**: GDP total expenditure, GDI total income
(should be the same, roughly);
* **GNP**: N - national;
* **NNP**: net national product, GNP - depreciation;
* **National income**: $\approx$ NNP;
* **Personal income**;
* **Disposable personal income**;

According to the book, they should be at the same trend. So, when the trend of
these figure, we shall ask for reasons.

## The Components of GDP

**The identical equation of GDP**:

$$
Y(\text{GDP}) = \text{Consumption} + \text{Investment} + \text{Government purchases} + \text{Net Exports}
$$

### Consumption

spending by households on goods and services "with the exception of purchases of
new housing" (it is in investment).

### Investment

purchase of goods (called capital goods) that will be used in the future to
produce more goods and services.

the sum of purchases of business capital, residential capital, and inventories.  
The intellectural property products in the business capital part.

### Government Purchases

spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.  
alias: government consumption expenditure and gross investment  

transfer payments are not in the government purchases part (they do not reflect
the economy's production).  
**Question**: So, are transfer payments counted as GDP?

### Net Exports

foreign purchases of domestically produced goods (exports) minus the domestic
purchases of foreign goods (imports).  
**Why "net"**? Because the imports are already in other parts (eg: comsumption).

GDP per person = GDP per capita.

the data of GDP and its components are produced by [the Department of Commerce
(Bureau of Economic Analysis) in the US](https://www.bea.gov).

## Real versus Nominal GDP

* **nominal GDP**: production of goods and services valued at current prices;
* **real GDP**: production of goods and services valued at constant prices;

* **GDP deflator**:  

    $$
    \text{GDP deflator}=\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}
    \times 100
    $$

* **inflation rate computing with GDP deflator**:  

    $$
    \text{Inflation rate of year 2}=
    \frac{\text{GDP deflator of year 2 - GDP deflator of year 1}}
    {\text{GDP deflator of year 1}} \times 100.
    $$

* old rule of thumb for *recession*: two consecutive quarters of falling real
GDP.

## Is GDP a Good Measure of Economic Well-Being?
GDP is a good measure of economic well-being for most—but not all—purposes.
It is important to keep in mind what GDP includes and what it leaves out.
