# Ten Principles of Economics

## How People Make Decisions

an economy is just a group of people dealing with one another as they go about their lives. (“经济”的定义)
1. People Face Trade-Offs  
    **efficiency vs. equality** (效率vs.公平)  
    people are likely to make good decisions only if they understand the options available to them.
2. The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It  
    **opportunity cost** (机会成本)  
    例子：退学加入职业联盟的运动员、电竞选手
3. Rational People Think at the Margin  
    Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but often involve shades of gray  
    marginal change  
    例子：水vs.钻石  
    marginal change not avarage cost
4. People Respond to Incentives  
    “People respond to incentives. The rest is commentary.”  
    the influence of prices on the behavior of consumers and producers is crucial to how a market economy allocates scarce resources  
    价格——一种激励  
    例子：安全带 车祸变多，司机死亡人数无明显变化，但行人死亡人数上升  
    When analyzing any policy, we must consider not only the direct effects but also the less obvious indirect effects that work through incentives.

## How People Interact

1. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off  
    The Chinese, as well as the French, Egyptians, and Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our competitors
2. Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity  
    The theory behind central planning was that only the government could organize economic activity in a way that promoted well-being for the country as a whole.  
    Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “invisible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes  
    prices are the instrument with which the invisible hand directs economic activity  
    巧合：1776年，亚当斯密出版《The Wealth of Nations》，美国革命者签署《独立宣言》；更巧合地是，他们背后有着类似的思想：Individuals are usually best left to their own devices, without the heavy hand of government directing their actions
3. Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes  
    property rights (产权)  
    market failure  
    market power (市场势力)  
    竞争

## How the Economy as a Whole Works

1. A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services  
    Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount of goods and services produced by each unit of labor input
2. Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money

3. Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment
