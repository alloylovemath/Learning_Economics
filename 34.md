# The Influence of Monetary and Fiscal Policy on Aggerate Demand

Brief ideas:  
* both monetary and fiscal policy influence aggregate demand;
* monetary policy-central bank;
* fiscal policy-president & Congress (US), ministry of finance (CHN);
* desired spending by households and firms determines the overall demand for
goods and services

## How Monetary Policy Influences Aggregate Demand

Review: wealth effect, interest-rate effect, exchange-rate effect  
**They are not of equal importance!**

* money holdings are a small part of wealth-the least important;
* exchange-rate effect-depends on the ratio of exports and imports of GDP;
* (For the US), interest-rate effect is the most important

**theory of liquidity preference**: Keynes’s theory that the interest rate
adjusts to bring money supply and money demand into balance

### The Theory of Liquidity Preference

nominal or real?  
**The answer is both**. In the analysis that follows, we hold constant the expected rate of inflation. This assumption is reasonable for studying the economy in the short run, because **expected inflation is typically stable over short periods of time**.

#### Money Supply

the quantity of money supplied in the economy is **fixed** at whatever level the
Fed decides to set it-a **vertical** supply curve

#### Money Demand

liquidity vs. profitability-interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding
money-the money demand curve slopes downward

pass

### The Downward Slope of the Aggregate-Demand Curve

price level up->interest rate rise->investment down->output down->
downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve

### Changes in the Money Supply

**When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and
increases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level,
shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right**

### The Role of Interest-Rate Targets in Fed Policy

In the past, the Fed has at times set a target for the money supply, but that is
no longer the case. The Fed now conducts policy by setting a target for the
federal funds rate—the interest rate that banks charge one another for
short-term loans

reasons for why targeting on interest rate:  
* money supply is hard to measure with sufficient precision;
* money demand fluctuates over time, thus, the interest rate, output also
fluctuates. Targeting on interest rate, the Fed can accommodates the day-to-day
shifts in money demand by adjusting the money supply accordingly.

reason for that the Fed can target on interest rate: according to the liquidity
preference theory, monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money
supply or in terms of the interest rate

Changes in monetary policy aimed at expanding aggregate demand can be described
either as increasing the money supply or as lowering the interest rate

### The Zero Lower Bound

**liquidity trap**: if interest rates have already fallen to around zero,
monetary policy may no longer be effective

In this environment, expansionary monetary policy raises the supply of money, making the public’s asset portfolio more liquid, but because interest rates can’t fall any further, the extra liquidity might not have any effect. Aggregate demand, production, and employment may be “trapped” at low levels.

What can the central bank do?  
* **forward guidance**: the central bank commit itself to keeping interest rates
low for an extended period of time;
* **quantitative easing**: the central bank conduct expansionary open-market operations using a larger variety of financial instruments;
* the central bank commit itself to keeping the expansion in money to increase
the inflation rate. Thus, even the nominal interest rate may have fallen to 
near 0, the real interest rate could fall further (negative).

## How Fiscal Policy Influences Aggregate Demand

**fiscal policy**: the government’ choices regarding the overall levels of
government purchases and taxes

In the short run, however, the primary effect of fiscal policy is on the
aggregate demand for goods and services

### Changes in Government Purchases

when the government alters its own purchases of goods and services, it shifts
the aggregate-demand curve directly

If the amount government purchased is $20 billion, will the aggregate demand
increase $20 billion? Maybe not. -**the multiplier effect**, **the crowding-out effect**

### The Multiplier Effect

* **the multiplier effect**: the additional shifts in aggregate demand that
result when expansionary fiscal policy increases income and thereby increases
consumer spending

* **investment accelerator**: positive feedback from demand to investment

### A Formula for the Spending Multiplier

* **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)**—the fraction of extra income that a household consumes rather than saves

$$
\begin{array}{c}
G + MPC \times G + MPC^{2} \times G + \cdots,\\
\Rightarrow \text{Multiplier} = (1 + MPC + MPC^{2} + \cdots) =
{\Large\frac{1}{1 - MPC}}
\end{array}
$$

a higher MPC means a larger multiplier-the multiplier arises because higher
income induces greater consumer spending. The higher the MPC, the more
consumption responds to a change in income, and the larger the multiplier.

### Other Applications of the Multiplier Effect

The multiplier applies to any event that alters spending on any component of
GDP—consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports.

The multiplier is an important concept in macroeconomics because it shows how
the economy can amplify the impact of changes in spending.

### The Crowding-Out Effect

* **crowding-out effect**: The reduction in aggregate demand that results when a
fiscal expansion raises the interest rate

government purchase increase->money demand increase->raise interest rate->
investment down->as the increase in government purchases increases the demand
for goods and services, it may also crowd out investment

**When the government increases its purchases by $20 billion, the aggregate
demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than $20 billion
depending on the sizes of the multiplier and crowding-out effects.**

### Changes in Taxes

Much like the government purchase.

except for multipiler effect and crowding-out effect , households’ perceptions
about whether the tax change is permanent or temporary also influence the effect
of the result.

## Using Policy to Stabilize the Economy

### The Case for Active Stabilization Policy

* **animal spirits**: these arbitrary changes in attitude

### The Case against Active Stabilization Policy

The main argument against active monetary and fiscal policy is that these policies affect the economy with a long lag.

### Automatic Stabilizers

the lags in implementation reduce the efficacy of policy as a tool for short-run stabilization

Automatic stabilizers: changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand
when the economy goes into a recession but that occur without policymakers
having to take any deliberate action
