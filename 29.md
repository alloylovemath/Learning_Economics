# The Monetary System

## The Meaning of Money

**Money**: the set of assets in an economy that people regularly use to buy
goods and services from other people.

money $\ne$ wealth

### The Functions of Money

Money has three functions: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of account,
and a store of value:  
* **medium of exchange**: an item that buyers give to sellers when they purchase
goods and services;
* **unit of account**: the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts;
* **store of value**: an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power
from the present to the future, and money is not the only one

The term wealth is used to refer to the total of all stores of value, including
both money and nonmonetary assets.

**liquidity**: the ease with which an asset can be converted into the economy’s
medium of exchange.

**This link between the price level and the value of money is key to
understanding how money affects the economy.**

### The Kinds of Money

**intrinsic value**: the item would have value even if it were not used as
money.

**commodity money**: money that takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic
value.

When an economy uses gold as money (or uses paper money that is convertible into
gold on demand), it is said to be operating under a **gold standard (金本位)**.

A **fiat** is an order or decree, and fiat money is established as money by
government decree.

**fiat money**: money without intrinsic value that is used as money by
government decree.

### Money in the U.S. Economy

**money stock**: the quantity of money circulating in the economy.

people with credit cards probably hold less money on average than people without
credit cards.

## The Federal Reserve System

**Central bank**: an institution designed to oversee the banking system and
regulate the quantity of money.  
eg: Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European
Central Bank, The People's Bank of China.

### The Fed’s Organization

Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. (chair & governors);  
Chair, 4 years, appointed by the president;  
Governor, 14-years, appointed by the president. Fed governors are given long
terms to give them independence from short-term political pressures when they
formulate monetary policy.

Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities, president.

The Fed has two related jobs:  
* monitors banks; lender of last resort (bank's bank);
* control **money supply**: the quantity of money that is made available in the
economy, through **monetary policy**, the setting of the money supply by
policymakers in the central bank.

### The Federal Open Market Committee

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), meets every 6 weeks.

members of the Board of Governors and 5 of the 12 regional bank presidents. All
12 regional presidents attend each FOMC meeting, but only five get to vote.

**The Fed’s policy decisions are key determinants of inflation in the long run
and employment and production in the short run.**

## Banks and the Money Supply

Well, this part is important, but I won't cover it detaily. Because I majored in
finance, so I am quite familiar with them... For more detailed introduction
for this part, I recommand you to read the book *The Economics of Money,
Banking, and Financial Markets* written by Frederic S. Mishkin.

**credit crunch (信用危机)**: the shortage of capital induced the banks to
reduce lending, which will in turn contributed to a severe downturn in economic
activity.

## The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control

The tool of the Fed to control the money supply can be grouped in two groups:  
* those that influence the **quantity** of reserves;
* those that influence the **reserve ratio** and in turn the money multiplier

### How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves

#### Open-Market Operations

Open-market operations are the tool of monetary policy that the Fed
uses most often.

easy to conduct & change the money supply by a small or large amount

#### Fed Lending to Banks

discount window, discount rate (再贴现率);

The Fed lends to banks not only to control the money supply but also to help
financial institutions when they are in trouble.

### How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio

#### Reserve Requirements

The Fed changes reserve requirements only rarely because such changes disrupt
the business of banking.

Moreover, this particular tool has become less effective in recent years as
banks have increasingly decided to hold excess reserves.

#### Paying Interest on Reserves

### Problems in Controlling the Money Supply

The Fed does not control the amount of money that households choose to hold as
deposits in banks.

The Fed does not control the amount that bankers choose to lend.

(Yet if the Fed is vigilant, these problems need not be large)

bank run (银行挤兑): "reversed the process of money creation, as bankers
responded to falling reserves by reducing bank loans. At the same time, bankers
increased their reserve ratios so that they would have enough cash on hand to
meet their depositors’ demands in any future bank runs".

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, The policy of government deposit
insurance has costs: Bankers whose deposits are guaranteed may have too little
incentive to avoid bad risks when making loans.

### The Federal Funds Rate

**federal funds rate**: the short-term (typically overnight) interest rate that
banks charge one another for loans.

It work with the discount rate.

In recent years, the Fed has set a target goal for the federal funds rate.

**Open-market purchases lower the federal funds rate, and open-market sales
raise the federal funds rate.**

**Other things being equal, a decrease in the target for the federal
funds rate means an expansion in the money supply, and an increase
in the target for the federal funds rate means a contraction in the money
supply.**
