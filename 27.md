# The Basic Tools of Finance

**Finance**: the field that studies how people make decisions regarding the
allocation of resources over time and the handling of risk.

## $\S 1$ Present Value: Measuring the Time Value of Money

**Formula**:  

$$
\text{FV} = \text{PV} \cdot (1 + r)^{N}
$$

$$
\text{PV} = \text{FV} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{N}}
$$

Here:  
* $\text{PV}$: **present value**, the amount of money today needed to
produce a future amount of money, given prevailing interest rates;
* $\text{FV}$: **future value**, the amount of money in the future that an
amount of money today will yield, given prevailing interest rates

And the formula is based on **compounding**, the accumulation of a sum of
money in, say, a bank account, where the interest earned remains in the
account to earn additional interest in the future

The process of finding a present value of a future sum of money is called
**discounting**.

Investment—and thus the quantity of loanable funds demanded—declines when the interest rate rises.

**Rule of 70**: if some amount grows at a rate of x percent per year, then that amount doubles in approximately 70/x years.

## $\S 2$ Managing Risk

> The rational response to risk is not to avoid it at any cost but to take
it into account in your decision making.

### $\S 2.1$ Risk Aversion

**Risk Aversion**: a dislike of uncertainty. It means that risk aversion people
dislike bad things, But moreover, it also means that the risk aversions dislike
bad things more than they like comparable good things.

**Utility**: a pearson's subjective measure of well-being or satisfaction.

The utility function has a property-**diminishing marginal utility**, the more wealth a person has, the less utility she gets from an additional dollar. (The utility function is a concave function? I guess).

### $\S 2.2$ The Markets for Insurance

The role of insurance is not to eliminate the risks inherent in life but to
spread them around more efficiently.

**Adverse selection**: A high-risk person is more likely to apply for insurance
than a low-risk person because a high-risk person would benefit more from
insurance protection.

**Moral hazard**: After people buy insurance, they have less incentive to be
careful about their risky behavior because the insurance company will cover much
of the resulting losses.

### $\S 2.3$ Diversification of Firm-Specific Risk

"Don’t put all your eggs in one basket"-**diversification**, the reduction of
risk achieved by replacing a single risk with a large number of smaller,
unrelated risks.

Diversification can eliminate **firm-specific risk**—the uncertainty associated
with a specific company; But diversification cannot eliminate **market
risk**—the uncertainty associated with the entire economy, which affects all
companies traded on the stock market.

### $\S 2.4$ The Trade-Off between Risk and Return

The higher average return that they enjoy comes at the price of higher risk.

## $\S 3$ Asset Valuation

### $\S 3.1$ Fundamental Analysis

To decide which businesses you want to own, it is natural to consider two things: **the value of that share of the business** and **the price at which the shares are being sold**.

The term **fundamental analysis** refers to the detailed analysis of a company
in order to estimate its value.

**Factors affect the profitability**: the demand for its product, the amount and
kinds of capital it has in place, the degree of competition it confronts, the
extent of unionization of its workers, the loyalty of its customers, the
government regulations and taxes it faces, and so on.

Some figures relate to stocks:  
* **dividend yield**, which is the dividend expressed as a percentage of the
stock’s price;
* **Earnings per share** is the company’s total earnings divided by the number
of shares of stock outstanding;
* The **price-earnings ratio**, often called the **P/E**, is the price of one
share of a corporation’s stock divided by the corporation’s earnings per share
over the past year  
	case: A high P/E indicates that a corporation’s stock is expensive relative
	to its recent earnings, suggesting either that people expect earnings to
	rise in the future or that the stock is overvalued.

### $\S 3.2$ The Efficient Markets Hypothesis

**efficient markets hypothesis**: the theory that asset prices reflect all
publicly available information about the value of an asset.

**informational efficiency**: the description of asset prices that rationally
reflect all available information.

**random walk**: the path of a variable whose changes are impossible to predict.

### $\S 3.3$ Market Irrationality

**speculative bubbles**: Whenever the price of an asset rises above what appears
to be its fundamental value, the market is said to be experiencing a speculative
bubble.

> Rational or not, the large movements in stock prices that we observe have
important macroeconomic implications. Stock market fluctuations often go hand in
hand with fluctuations in the economy more broadly.
