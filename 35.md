# The Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment

## The Phillips Curve

**Phillips curve**: the short-run relationship between inflation and
unemployment

### Origins of the Phillips Curve

* *The Relationship between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages
in the United Kingdom, 1861–1957.*, A. W. Phillips (1958);
* *Analytics of Anti-Inflation Policy*, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960)

**Opinion of Samuelson and Solow**:  
* low unemployment was associated with high aggregate demand, which in turn put
upward pressure on wages and prices throughout the economy
* they dubbed the negative association between inflation and unemployment
**the Phillips curve**;
* policymakers face a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, and the
Phillips curve illustrates that trade-off.

### Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and the Phillips Curve

**The Phillips curve shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that
arise in the short run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy
along the short-run aggregate supply curve**

Increases in the money supply, increases in government spending, or cuts in
taxes expand aggregate demand and move the economy to a point on the Phillips
curve with higher inflation and lower unemployment

## Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Expectations

Does this set of possible choices remain the same over time? In other words, is
the downward-sloping Phillips curve a stable relationship on which policymakers
can rely?

### The Long-Run Phillips Curve

* *The Role of Monetary PolicyThe Role of Monetary Policy*, Milton Friedman;
* Edmund Phelps;

**Their opinion**:  
* growth in the money supply as the primary determinant of inflation;
* monetary growth does not affect real variables such as output and employment;
* in the long run, the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment would not
be related;
* monetary policymakers face a long-run Phillips curve that is vertical;
* The vertical long-run Phillips curve illustrates the conclusion that
unemployment does not depend on money growth and inflation in the long run

### Reconciling Theory and Evidence

Theory vs. evidence->reconcile

Friedman and Phelps’s work was the basis of our discussion of the difference
between the short-run and long-run aggregate-supply curves in Chapter 33

expectations are the key to understanding how the short run and the long run are
related->**expected inflation**

Because the expected price level affects nominal wages, expected inflation is
one factor that determines the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curve

### The Natural Experiment for the Natural-Rate Hypothesis

**natural-rate hypothesis**: the claim that unemployment eventually returns to
its normal, or natural, rate, regardless of the rate of inflation

## Shifts in the Phillips Curve: The Role of Supply Shocks

changes in expected inflation shift the short-run Phillips curve

**supply shock**: an event that directly affects firms’ costs of production and
thus the prices they charge. it shifts the economy’s aggregate-supply curve and,
as a result, the Phillips curve.

Because firms need fewer workers to produce the smaller output, employment falls
and unemployment rises, the shift in aggregate supply leads to higher
unemployment and higher inflation->The short-run trade-off between inflation and
unemployment shifts to the right

whether the shift is temporary or permanent. The answer depends on how people
adjust their expectations of inflation

**accommodate** an adverse supply shock: increasing aggregate demand in an
effort to keep output from falling

## The Cost of Reducing Inflation

**Disinflation**: a reduction in the rate of inflation

disinflation is like slowing down, whereas deflation is like going in reverse

### The Sacrifice Ratio

Over time, as people come to understand that prices are rising more slowly,
**expected inflation falls**, and the short-run **Phillips curve shifts
downward**

if a nation wants to reduce inflation, it must endure a period of high
unemployment and low output

**sacrifice ratio**: the number of percentage points of annual output lost in
the process of reducing inflation by 1 percentage point

### Rational Expectations and the Possibility of Costless Disinflation

**rational expectations**: people optimally use all the information they have,
including information about government policies, when forecasting the future
(Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Robert Barro)

when economic policies change, people adjust their expectations of inflation
accordingly

> How costly such a move would be in terms of forgone output and how long it
would be in taking effect would depend partly on how resolute and evident the
government’s commitment was.

### The Volcker Disinflation

policymakers cannot count on people to immediately believe them when they
announce a policy of disinflation
