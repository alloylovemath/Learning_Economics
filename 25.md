# Production and Growth

**Some ideas**:  

* fundamental problem in macroeconomics:  
    1. How to explain the differences in GDP among countries;
    2. How to maintain/promote GDP;

> “The consequences for human welfare in questions like these are simply
staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about
anything else.”  -- *Robert Lucas (Nobel Price winner)*

* GDP -> economic prosperity, GDP growth -> economic progress;

* **Productivity**:  
    1. definition: the amount of goods and services produced for each hour of
    work;
    2. determine the standard of living;
    3. which factors determing productivities;
    4. relationship between productivity and policies;

## $\S 1$ Economic Growth around the World

The case of John D. Rockefeller on page 508 is worth looking.

## $\S 2$ Productivity: Its Role and Determinants

### Why Productivity Is So Important

* **productivity**: the quantity of goods and services produced from each unit
of labor input;
* Two things relate to the relationship between productivity and standard of
living:  
    Put simply, an economy’s income is the economy’s output (GDP);  
    Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that a
    country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and
    services.

### How Productivity Is Determined

**Factors determines productivity**: physical capital, human capital, natural
resources, and technological knowledge

**The Productivity Function**:  

$$
Y = A \times F(L, K, H, N).
$$

Here, L-quantity of labor, K-physical capital, H-human capital, N-natural
resource, A-technological knowledge.

**constant returns to scale**: doubling all inputs causes the amount of output to
double also. And if a productivity function has it, we can get:  

$$
Y/L = A \times F(L/L, K/L, H/L, N/L).
$$

It can be seen as a summary of this section.

1. Physical Capital per Worker:  
    The stock of equipment and structures used to produce goods and services is
    called physical capital, or **just capital**;  
    the inputs used to produce goods and services—labor, capital, and so on—are
    called the **factors of production (生产要素)**;  
    capital is **a produced factor in production** - capital is an input into
    the production process that in the past was an output from the production
    process

2. Human Capital per Worker:  
    Human capital is the economist’s term for the knowledge and skills that
    workers acquire through education, training, and experience;  
    human capital is also a produced factor of production;  
    Producing human capital requires inputs in the form of teachers, libraries,
    and student time

3. Natural Resources per Worker:  
    Natural resources are inputs into production that are provided by nature;  
    Although natural resources can be important, they are not necessary for an
    economy to be highly productive in producing goods and services (eg: Japan)

4. Technological Knowledge:  
    technological knowledge—the understanding of the best ways to produce goods
    and services;  
    Some of it are common sense (eg: assembly-line production), others may be
    proprietary (long time or short time);  
    **distinguish between technological knowledge and human capital** -
    Technological knowledge refers to society’s understanding about how the
    world works. Human capital refers to the resources expended transmitting
    this understanding to the labor force

## $\S 3$ Economic Growth and Public Policy

### Saving and Investment

Encouraging saving and investment is one way that a government can encourage
growth and, in the long run, raise an economy’s standard of living. Because it
leads to more production on capital goods, which in turn rises the productivity.

However, people face trade-offs. That is, for society to invest more in capital,
it must consume less and save more of its current income.

### Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect (收益递减和追赶效应)

**diminishing returns**: the property whereby the benefit from an extra unit of
an input declines as the quantity of the input increases  
Capital’ diminishing returns is sometimes called the **diminishing marginal
product of capital**.

In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity
and income but not to higher growth in these variables.

Implication - **catch-up effect**: the property whereby countries that start off
poor tend to grow more rapidly than countries that start off rich.

Note that it is good to be “Most Improved,” given the starting point, but it is
even better to be “Best Student.”

### Investment from Abroad

**Two types**:  
* A capital investment that is owned and operated by a foreign entity is called
**foreign direct investment**
* An investment financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents
is called **foreign portfolio investment**

One statistical thing is the investment from abroad raise GNP less than GDP.

**The benefits of investment from abroad**:  
* increase the economy’s stock of capital (similar with the rise in domestic
saving);
* one way for poor countries to learn the state-of-the-art technologies
developed and used in richer countries

Some knowledge of **the World Bank** and **International Monetary Fund (IMF)**
can be found in this section,

### Education

Education—investment in human capital—is at least as important as investment
in physical capital for a country’s long-run economic success.

It has opportunity cost - When students are in school, they forgo the wages they
could have earned as members of the labor force.

An **externality** is the effect of one person’s actions on the well-being of a
bystander. And some economist have argued that human capital confers positive
externalities - they can bring new ideas into the society's pool of knowledge.

**brain drain**—the emigration of many of the most highly educated workers to
rich countries. One dilemma faced by policy maker in poor contries is brain
drain.

### Health and Nutrition

Some interesting fact such as the relationship between height and wealth.

### Property Rights and Political Stability

**Property rights** refer to the ability of people to exercise authority over
the resources they own.

* efficient court system - protect property rights;
* honest government officials - less corruption;
* stable constitution

### Free Trade

**Two types**:  
* **inward-oriented policies**, aim to increase productivity and living
standards within the country by avoiding interaction with the rest of the world  
    protection, distrust of foreigners etc.
* **outward-oriented policies**, integrate these countries into the world
economy  
    Trade is, in some ways, a type of technology

* The adverse impact of inward orientation:  
    Economy with inward orientation policies would need to produce all the goods
    it consumes. It would also have to produce all its own capital goods, rather
    than importing state-of-the-art equipment from other states. Living
    standards in Ohio would fall immediately, and the problem would likely only
    get worse over time (eg: Argentina in 20th century)

### Research and Development

knowledge is a public good: That is, once one person discovers an idea, the
idea enters society’s pool of knowledge and other people can freely use it.

**Tools used by the US government**:  
1. research grants from the National Science Foundation and the National
Institutes of Health;
2. tax breaks for firms engaging in research and development;
3. patent system-turning her new idea from a public good into a private good,
temporarily;

### Population Growth

The most direct effect is on the size of the labor force.

Others:  
* Stretching Natural Resources, *Thomas Robert Malthus*, fortunately wrong;
* Diluting the Capital Stock;
* Promoting Technological Progress-more people, more talent;
