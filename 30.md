# Money Growth and Inflation

Berief ideas:  
* **quantity theory of money**, which can explain moderate inflation and
hyperinflation.
* What's the cost of inflation?

## The Classical Theory of Inflation

### The Level of Prices and the Value of Money

First insight about inflation: it is more about the value of money than about
the value of goods.

**Let $P$ be the price index, $1/P$ is the value of money in terms of goods and
service.**

When the overall price level rises, the value of money falls.

### Money Supply, Money Demand, and Monetary Equilibrium

The supply and demand for money determines the value of money.

**Simply take the quantity of money supplied as a policy variable that the Fed
controls.**

For demand, there are many factors affect the demand of money, one that is
particularly important-the average level of prices in the economy. That is, a
higher price level (a lower value of money) increases the quantity of money
demanded.

**In the long run, money supply and money demand are brought into equilibrium by the overall level of prices**

### The Effects of a Monetary Injection

when an increase in the money supply makes dollars more plentiful, the
result is an increase in the price level that makes each dollar less valuable

**quantity theory of money**: the quantity of money available in an economy
determines the value of money, and growth in the quantity of money is the
primary cause of inflation.

> Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. -*Milton Friedman*

### A Brief Look at the Adjustment Process

How does the economy move from the old to the new equilibrium?

1. the injection of money increases the demand for goods and services;  
	However, the injection doesn't change the economy's ability to produce goods
	and service;
2. the greater demand for goods and services causes the prices of goods and
services to increase;
3. The increase in the price level, in turn, increases the quantity of money
demanded because people are using more dollars for every transaction
4. Eventually, the economy reaches a new equilibrium

### The Classical Dichotomy and Monetary Neutrality

* **nominal variables**: variables measured in monetary units;
* **real variables**: variables measured in physical units;

The separation of real and nominal variables is now called the classical
dichotomy.

**relative price**: the price of one thing in terms of another, relative prices
are real variables.

Why separate variables into these groups?

Different forces influence real and nominal variables.  
According to classical analysis, nominal variables are influenced by
developments in the economy’ monetary system, whereas real variables are not.

**monetary neutrality**: the irrelevance of monetary changes to real variables.

**most economists today believe that over short periods of time—within the span
of a year or two—monetary changes affect real variables**

### Velocity and the Quantity Equation

**velocity of money**: the speed at which the typical dollar bill travels around
the economy from wallet to wallet.

We divide nominal value of output (nominal GDP) by the quantity of money to get
the velocity of money:  

$$
V = \frac{P \times Y}{M}.
$$

Here, $P$ is the GDP deflator, $Y$ is the real GDP, so the numerator is the
nominal GDP; $M$ is the quantity of money. There is a case in the book on page
620 explain the formula pretty well which you can refer to.

**quantity equation**:  

$$
M \times V = P \times Y.
$$

It turns out that the velocity of money is relatively stable. Thus, for some
purposes, the assumption of constant velocity is a good approximation.

all the elements necessary to explain the equilibrium price level and inflation
rate:  
1. $M$ changes, and $V$ stable;
2. $Y$ (real GDP) won't be affected by the change (monetary neutrality);
3. $P$ changes;

### The Inflation Tax

Why do the central banks of these countries choose to print so much money that
its value is certain to fall rapidly over time?  
The answer is that the governments of these countries are using money creation
as a way to pay for their spending. The government has high spending, inadequate
tax revenue, and limited ability to borrow.

**Inflation tax**: the government raises revenue by printing money.

### The Fisher Effect

We say that the calculation formula for real interest rate is:  

$$
r_{\text{real}} = r_{\text{nominal}} - \pi.
$$

Now, let's re-write this formula:  

$$
r_{\text{nominal}} = r_{\text{real}} + \pi.
$$

This new arrangement is helpful since different forces determine each of the two
terms on the right side of this equation.

**When the Fed increases, the rate of money growth, the long-run result is both a
higher inflation rate and a higher nominal interest rate.**

**Fisher effect**: the one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to
the inflation rate. (long-run, since inflation may be unanticipated in
short-run)

More precisely, **the Fisher effect states that the nominal interest rate adjusts
to expected inflation. Expected inflation moves with actual inflation in the
long run but not necessarily in the short run.**

## The Costs of Inflation

In the US, recently, the economic terms mentioned most often are *inflation*,
*unemployment*, *productivity*.

### A Fall in Purchasing Power? The Inflation Fallacy

"Inflation directly lowers living standards", but is it right?

**inflation does not in itself reduce people’s real purchasing power**.  
Reason:  
* sellers of goods and services get more for what they sell;
* inflation in incomes goes hand in hand with inflation in prices;

### Shoeleather Costs

Like other taxes, the inflation tax also causes deadweight losses because people
waste scarce resources trying to avoid it.

**shoeleather cost**: the cost of reducing your money holdings.

### Menu Costs

**menu costs**: the costs of price adjustment. Menu costs include the costs of
deciding on new prices, printing new price lists and catalogs, sending these new
price lists and catalogs to dealers and customers, advertising the new prices,
and even dealing with customer annoyance over price changes.

### Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources

market economies rely on relative prices to allocate scarce resources. but
inflation may distort the relative price, thus, markets are less able to
allocate resources to their best use.

### Inflation-Induced Tax Distortions

inflation tends to raise the tax burden on income earned from savings

### A Special Cost of Unexpected Inflation: Arbitrary Redistributions of Wealth

Case: unexpected changes in prices redistribute wealth among debtors and
creditors.

Inflation is especially volatile and uncertain when the average rate of
inflation is high.

### Inflation Is Bad, but Deflation May Be Worse

deflation is often a symptom of deeper economic problems


"as the economy makes the transition to the lower inflation rate, the change in
monetary policy will likely disrupt production and employment. That is, even
though monetary policy is neutral in the long run, it has profound effects on
real variables in the short run"
